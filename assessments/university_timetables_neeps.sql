-- 5. Give a list of the student groups which take modules with the word 'Database' in the name.
SELECT DISTINCT s.id, s.name -- brings in the id as well, as there is a id with no name.

-- 6. Show the 'size' of each of the co72010 events. Size is the total number of students attending each event.

-- 10. How many members of staff have contact time which is greater than the average?
-- this will include all staff including those with no event
-- average contact time is defined as the number of hour the staffs teaches an event
-- staff with no associted events will have a contact time of 0 and included in the average
-- there are event associated with more than 1 staff; in those cases all staffs assocaited are getting full credit for the contact hours

-- 12. Produce a table showing the utilisation rate and the occupancy level for all rooms with a capacity more than 60.
-- Definitions: 
    -- Utilisation rate
        -- How often a room is used relative to the total available time. 
        -- Utilisation rate = total hours of events in the room / total hours available (we will get the total hours available by querying the event table)
    -- Occupancy level: 
        -- What it measures: How full a room is when itâ€™s being used.
        -- Occupancy level = average number of students when occupied / room capacity
-- Use inner join: ignore events with no room or no students attending

-- 1. Querty to check occupacny rate
-- A lot of rooms are overused, it could be that the room capacity is not accurate. For example, room co.B7 is showing different capacity in the SQLZOO front end VS query. 
-- The final query will be assuming that the capacity from the query is correct instead of the front end one. 
-- It will mean that over half of the rooms are overused. 
-- There is also only 1 room with capaicty more than 60 in the queried table. 

-- Student size needs to be summarised before used to join the event table, this is because there are multiple group of students attending an event at the same time.
