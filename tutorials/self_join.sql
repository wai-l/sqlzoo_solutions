-- Self JOIN - Edinburgh Buses
--10
-- Find the routes involving two buses that can go from Craiglockhart to Lochend.
-- Show the bus no. and company for the first bus, the name of the stop for the transfer, and the bus no. and company for the second bus.
-- Hint
-- Self-join twice to find buses that visit Craiglockhart and Lochend, then join those on matching stops.

-- alternative solution
-- instead of using multiple CTEs to join the route and stops, only have 2 CTEs in which the stops are joined to the route.
